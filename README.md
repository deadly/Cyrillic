# How to Use
The plugin works automatically; however, if you want to send a message without cyrillic for any purpose add -ignore before your message (e.g: "-ignore hello, how are you?")

The plugin will automatically send a without without cyrillic if the message contains certain conditions (e.g: pings, common bot command prefixes, emotes, links, and code blocks)
